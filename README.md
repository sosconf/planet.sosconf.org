# git-wiki

Git-wiki is a **modular and full featured wiki** powered by Git, [GitHub](https://pages.github.com/)/[Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/product/pages/) Pages and pull requests!

The git-wiki project is composed by 3 different repository:

- [git-wiki-theme](https://github.com/Drassil/git-wiki-theme): This is the repository of the theme that implements the wiki functionalities. You would have not fork it unless you need to send a Pull Request or create your wiki project from scratch.

- [git-wiki-skeleton](https://github.com/Drassil/git-wiki-skeleton): This is the repo that you should fork or use as a template. It uses the [jekyll remote theme](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-remote-theme) functionality that allows you to create your own wiki based on git-wiki-theme. By using the remote functionality you can automatically keep your wiki always updated with latest features from the **git-wiki-theme**, but you can also fully customize it. 

- [git-wiki](https://github.com/Drassil/git-wiki): This is the documentation repository and website of the **git-wiki-theme** project. You would have not fork it unless you want to contribute to the git-wiki project documentation.
